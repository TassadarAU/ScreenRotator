![Updated Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frecel/ScreenRotator/master/Screenshot%20from%202016-07-05%2013-03-54.png)

ScreenRotator requires python3-gi to work. You can install it by running:
```
sudo apt install python3-gi
```

If you are autostarting ScreenRotator and the icon does not show up in your
system tray change the path to the icon in line 13 of ScreenRotator.py to an
absolute path.

The icon is from Google's Material Desing icon pack (https://materialdesignicons.com/)
